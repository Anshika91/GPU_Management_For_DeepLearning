#Problem
How to create virtual environment for tensorflow-gpu in anaconda
#Solution
Here are the steps to create a virtual environment for TensorFlow-GPU in Anaconda:

1.Open Anaconda Navigator or Anaconda Prompt.
2.Create a new virtual environment by running the following command:
-------------------------------------------------------
| conda create -n tensorflow_gpu_env tensorflow-gpu | |
-------------------------------------------------------
3.Activate the new virtual environment by running the following command:
---------------------------------
| conda activate tensorflow-gpu |
---------------------------------
4.Verify the installation of TensorFlow-GPU by running the following command in Python:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| import tensorflow as tf                                                                |
| print("Num GPUs Available :",len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('gpu'))) |
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


If the output is (1), it means that TensorFlow-GPU has been successfully installed in your virtual environment.
Note: Make sure that you have a GPU and the corresponding drivers installed on your system. Also, check if CUDA and cuDNN are compatible
with the version of TensorFlow-GPU you are installing.
for importing keras we write a command on Anaconda Prompt that is :
 ------------------------------
| from tensorflow import keras |
 ------------------------------

Thank You.....
